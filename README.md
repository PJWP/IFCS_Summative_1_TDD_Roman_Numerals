# IFCS_Summative_1_TDD_Roman_Numerals
I am going to be demonstrating Test Driven Development (TDD) using Python and pytest. The goal is to implement a function that converts integers into roman numerals (1-3999), following rules including additive and subtractive notation. I will set up a full Continuous Integration pipeline using GitHub Actions to automatically run tests
